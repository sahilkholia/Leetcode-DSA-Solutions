# 🧠 Leetcode-DSA-Solutions

Welcome to the **Leetcode-DSA-Solutions** repository!  
This repo is a personal daily challenge where I solve at least one LeetCode problem every day, covering a wide range of Data Structures and Algorithms.

Each solution is:
- ✅ Cleanly implemented in Java
- 🧪 Accompanied by JUnit 5 test cases
- 🗂️ Organized for easy navigation

---

## 📌 Highlights

- 🚀 **Daily updates** with new problems and solutions
- 🧠 Covers all major DSA topics (Arrays, Trees, Graphs, DP, etc.)
- 🧪 **JUnit 5** for robust testing and validation
- 📚 Great for interview prep and revision
